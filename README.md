Gender-Based Violence Reporting App
A simple web application built with Streamlit and Python for reporting incidents of gender-based violence. The app provides a user-friendly form with optional anonymity.

How to Run
Install dependencies:

pip install streamlit pandas

Run the app:

streamlit run app.py

Note on Data Persistence
This is a proof-of-concept application. Reports are displayed as a placeholder and are not saved to a database. For a production-ready version, a secure solution like Google Firestore would be required.
